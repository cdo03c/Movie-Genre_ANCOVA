This is a final project for the Penn State graduate course STAT502.  In this project I extract movie data from IMDB and used the average user rating to see if there is a difference among three genres: Action, Drama, and Comedy.

This repo contains the following:
1) adata set I created used the "Random Title" feature on the IMDB website
2) the R code I wrote to run an unequal slopes ANCOVA
3) the python code I wrote to run an unequal slopes ANCOVA
